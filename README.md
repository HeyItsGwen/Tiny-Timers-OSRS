# Tiny Timers OSRS

https://heyitsgwen.github.io/Tiny-Timers-OSRS/

 A set of little tiny timers for seaweed, herb, birdhouse, tree, and fruit tree runs in OSRS. Built to have your browser minimized as small as possible, so that you can see timers for your produce without being logged into the game and without it taking up much space on your desktop, as well as being visible from the toolbar when overing over your browsers icon.

## How to use Tiny Timers
 To start a timer, pick the one you'd like, and hit go! If you want to end the timer, hit end!

 You can also choose which timers you'd like to be displayed by using the checkboxes above them.

 If you want a smaller screen, hit the popout link underneath the timers, and a much smaller browser window will appear.

 This popout mode version can be made small enough that, when you hover over the browser icon in your taskbar, you can see colors/percentages of timers without having to focus the window.

## About
 Tiny timers was made with vanilla javascript, [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.5/getting-started/introduction/) and sass for styling and responsive design. It works by running on a 1 minute loop while the site is loaded, meaning that if you refresh or leave the page the timer progress will be lost, but also that it keeps processing power low, doesn't need to access servers, and can be used entirely offline once loaded. 

 This can also be used on mobile, depending on your phones settings. If apps are allowed to continue running in the background, or while locked, the timers will keep going and you can check your run timers from anywhere.
